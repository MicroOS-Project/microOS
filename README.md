Our attempt at creating an operating system like program for ESP32 (for now).

You will need to upload [this](https://github.com/russhughes/st7789_mpy) firmware to your device in order for it to work.

If you want it to run at boot put 'import microOS' into your boot.py file.

TODO:

Fix menu bug so that first app menu option stays shown (please fix)

Add documentation.

Make the screensaver appear in all pages.
