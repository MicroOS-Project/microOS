About:

Our attempt at creating an operating system like program for micropython devices.

Display library is: https://github.com/devbis/st7789py_mpy
And text function is from: https://github.com/adafruit/micropython-adafruit-rgb-display/blob/master/rgb_text.py

If you want it to run at boot put 'import microOS' into your boot.py file.

TODO:

Fix menu bug so that first app menu option stays shown (please fix)
